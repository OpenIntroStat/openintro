I applied for a position in Feb 2020.  They started my paperwork to hire me in Mar 2020, but paused the process because they received an unusually high number of qualified applicants for similar positions.  They re-opened my position and asked me to re-apply with the new applicants.  I didn't get selected after they found an individual with slightly better qualifications than me.  The hiring manager told me off-the-record I had a solid resume, but the new applicant was slightly better so they went with him.  If he declined, they would have hired me instead.  

I was transitioning from private employment (~$89k per year) to government employment (~$93k per year).  Disappointing, but I appreciated the honest from the hiring manager!  

Separately, my private employer stated in May 2020 that there wouldn't be any bonuses or raise increases in 2020; however, they gave us bonuses in Jan 2021 because revenue didn't decline as much as they projected (0% decline actual versus -15% expected).  The bonuses are normally given out in Sep each year, but they made effective in Jan 2021.  They were one-time bonuses, not raises--mine was $1k.  

The numbers in my record may not add up completely, since not all of my end-of-year forms have arrived yet.  "

My taxable brokerage account is a portfolio of closed-end funds (CEFs) specializing in corporate bonds, senior loans, non-agency mortgages, common infrastructure equity, and preferred equity, which provides a 9.2% annual distribution yield on basis (currently at 11% yield on contributions, since all distributions have been reinvested back into the portfolio since inception).  That will act as my sole source of cash income indefinitely upon early retirement, leaving my traditional 401(k) target-date fund balance to grow untouched for as long as possible.  This approach is certainly not 100% optimized for tax efficiency, since a good portion of the CEF distributions are taxed as interest and not capital gains.  However, I view the monthly cash income stream as a good hedge against sequence of returns risk for the early years of retirement, since the distributions are largely stable and predictable (and not directly impacted by market price volatility, which is a key determining factor in income generation from a 3% or 4% withdrawal rate in the index fund drawdown approach)"

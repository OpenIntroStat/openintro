Essentially, you just need to go to BioMart, and

select "Ensembl Genes 96" (the number will change if the version changes) as the database and "uman Genes" as the dataset.

Click on "Filters", and set Gene type to coding and Transcript type to protein_coding.

From "Attributes", select whatever you want to see. The "CDS Length" is under "Structures".

Note structures no longer an option

\description{
A collection of all collisions between aircraft in wildlife that were
reported to the US Federal Aviation Administration between 1990 and 1997,
with details on the circumstances of the collision.
}
\details{
The FAA National Wildlife Strike Database contains strike reports that are
voluntarily reported to the FAA by pilots, airlines, airports and others.
Current research indicates that only about 20\\% of strikes are reported.
Wildlife strike reporting is not uniform as some organizations have more
robust voluntary reporting procedures. Because of variations in reporting,
users are cautioned that the comparisons between individual airports or
airlines may be misleading.

\description{
Pew Research conducted a poll to find whether American adults support
regulation or believe the private market will move the American economy
towards renewable energy.
}
\details{
The exact statements being selected were: (1) Government
regulations are necessary to encourage businesses and consumers to rely more
on renewable energy sources. (2) The private marketplace will ensure that
businesses and consumers rely more on renewable energy sources, even without
government regulations.

The actual sample size was 1012. However, the original data were not from a
simple random sample; after accounting for the design, the equivalent sample
size was about 705, which was what was used for the data set here to keep
things simpler for intro stat analyses.

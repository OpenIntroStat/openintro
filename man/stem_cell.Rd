\description{
Does treatment using embryonic stem cells (ESCs) help improve heart function
following a heart attack? Each sheep in the study was randomly assigned to
the ESC or control group, and the change in their hearts' pumping capacity
was measured in the study. A positive value corresponds to increased pumping
capacity, which generally suggests a stronger recovery.

\description{
For example, Pew Research Center conducted a survey with the following
question: "As you may know, by 2014 nearly all Americans will be required to
have health insurance. People who do not buy insurance will pay a penalty
while people who cannot afford it will receive financial help from the
government. Do you approve or disapprove of this policy?" For each randomly
sampled respondent, the statements in brackets were randomized: either they
were kept in the order given above, or the two statements were reversed.

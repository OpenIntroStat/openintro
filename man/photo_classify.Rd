\title{Photo classifications: fashion or not}
\format{
A data frame with 1822 observations on the following 2 variables.
\describe{
\item{mach_learn}{The prediction by the machine learning system as to whether the photo is about fashion or not.}
\item{truth}{The actual classification of the photo by a team of humans.}
}
}
\source{
The data are simulated / hypothetical.
}
\usage{
photo_classify
}
\description{
This is a simulated data set for photo classifications based on a machine
learning algorithm versus what the true classification is for those photos.
While the data are not real, they resemble performance that would be
reasonable to expect in a well-built classifier.
}
\details{
The hypothetical ML algorithm has a precision of 90\\%, meaning of those
photos it claims are fashion, about 90\\% of them are actually about fashion.
The recall of the ML algorithm is about 64\\%, meaning of the photos that are
about fashion, it correctly predicts that they are about fashion about 64\\%
of the time.

\description{
An experiment conducted by the MythBusters, a science entertainment TV
program on the Discovery Channel, tested if a person can be subconsciously
influenced into yawning if another person near them yawns. 50 people were
randomly assigned to two groups: 34 to a group where a person near them
yawned (treatment) and 16 to a group where there wasn't a person yawning
near them (control).

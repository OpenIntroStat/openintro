Welcome to the openintro GitHub repo! 

Thanks for taking an interest in our project! 

Before opening a new issue, please be sure to [search issues and pull requests](https://github.com/openintrostat/openintro/issues) to make sure the bug hasn’t been reported and/or already fixed in the development version. By default, the search will be pre-populated with `is:issue is:open`. You can [edit the qualifiers](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues-and-pull-requests/) (e.g. `is:pr`, `is:closed`) as needed. For example, you’d simply remove `is:open` to search *all* issues in the repo, open or closed.

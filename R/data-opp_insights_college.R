#' College education and upward mobility
#'
#' Opportunity Insights (\url{https://opportunityinsights.org/}) is a research initiative
#' with the goal of understanding upward mobility in the United States by studying
#' barriers to economic opportunity and translating findings into policy recommendations.
#' These data consist of a subset on anonymized dataset gathered in 2017 on all
#' college students in the United States from 1999 - 2013 (30 million students)
#' study to examine the association of higher education system and upward mobility.
#' The data includes parental income distributions and student earnings outcomes
#' by college. The data in this package do not include tiers 12 (less than two year
#' schools of any type), 13 (students attending college with insufficient data),
#' and 14 (students not in college between the ages of 19-22). Monetary values
#' are measured in 2015 dollars; i.e. adjusted for inflation to 2015 dollars.

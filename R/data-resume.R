#' Which resume attributes drive job callbacks?  (Race and gender under study.)
#'
#' This experiment data comes from a study that sought to understand the
#' influence of race and gender on job application callback rates. The study
#' monitored job postings in Boston and Chicago for several months during 2001
#' and 2002 and used this to build up a set of test cases. Over this time
#' period, the researchers randomly generating resumes to go out to a job
#' posting, such as years of experience and education details, to create a
#' realistic-looking resume. They then randomly assigned a name to the resume
#' that would communicate the applicant's gender and race. The first names
#' chosen for the study were selected so that the names would predominantly be
#' recognized as belonging to black or white individuals. For example, Lakisha
#' was a name that their survey indicated would be interpreted as a black
#' woman, while Greg was a name that would generally be interpreted to be
#' associated with a white male.
#'
#' Because this is an experiment, where the race and gender attributes are
#' being randomly assigned to the resumes, we can conclude that any
#' statistically significant difference in callback rates is causally linked to
#' these attributes.
#'
#' Do you think it's reasonable to make a causal conclusion? You may have some
#' health skepticism. However, do take care to appreciate that this was an
#' experiment: the first name (and so the inferred race and gender) were
#' randomly assigned to the resumes, and the quality and attributes of a resume
#' were assigned independent of the race and gender. This means that any
#' effects we observe are in fact causal, and the effects related to race are
#' both statistically significant and very large: white applicants had about a
#' 50\% better chance of getting a callback than black candidates.
#'
#' Do you still have doubts lingering in the back of your mind about the
#' validity of this study?  Maybe a counterargument about why the standard
#' conclusions from this study may not apply? The article summarizing the
#' results was exceptionally well-written, and it addresses many potential
#' concerns about the study's approach. So if you're feeling skeptical about
#' the conclusions, please find the link below and explore!

#' # Natural question: is this statisticaly significant?
#' # A proper analysis would take into account the

#' # compute the following statistic:
#' #     <callback rate for white candidates>
#' #     - <callback rate for black candidates>
#' # First contruct the callbacks for white and
#' # black candidates by ad ID:
#' table(resume$race)
#' cb_white <- with(
#'     subset(resume, race == "white"),
#'     tapply(received_callback, job_ad_id, mean))
#' cb_black <- with(
#'     subset(resume, race == "black"),
#'     tapply(received_callback, job_ad_id, mean))
#' # Next, compute the differences, where the
#' # names(cb_white) part ensures we matched up the
#' # job ad IDs.
#' diff <- cb_white - cb_black[names(cb_white)]
#' # Finally, we can apply a t-test on the differences:
#' t.test(diff)
#' # There is very strong evidence of an effect.
#'
#' # Here's a similar check with gender. There are
#' # more female-inferred candidates used on the resumes.
#' table(resume$gender)
#' cb_male <- with(

#'     tapply(received_callback, job_ad_id, mean))
#' diff <- cb_female - cb_male[names(cb_female)]
#' # The `na.rm = TRUE` part ensures we limit to jobs
#' # where both a male and female resume were sent.
#' t.test(diff, na.rm = TRUE)
#' # There is no statistically significant difference.
#'
#' # Was that the best analysis? Absolutely not!
#' # However, the analysis was unbiased. To get more
#' # precision on the estimates, we could build a
#' # multivariate model that includes many characteristics
#' # of the resumes sent, e.g. years of experience.
#' # Since those other characteristics were assigned
#' # independently of the race characteristics, this
#' # means the race finding will almost certainy will
#' # hold. However, it is possible that we'll find
#' # more interesting results with the gender investigation.

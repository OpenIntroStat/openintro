#' Friday the 13th
#'
#' This data set addresses issues of how superstitions regarding Friday the
#' 13th affect human behavior, and whether Friday the 13th is an unlucky day.
#' Scanlon, et al. collected data on traffic and shopping patterns and accident
#' frequency for Fridays the 6th and 13th between October of 1989 and November
#' of 1992.
#'
#' There are three types of observations: traffic, shopping, and accident. For
#' traffic, the researchers obtained information from the British Department of
#' Transport regarding the traffic flows between junctions 7 to 8 and junctions
#' 9 to 10 of the M25 motorway. For shopping, they collected the numbers of
#' shoppers in nine different supermarkets in southeast England. For accidents,
#' they collected numbers of emergency admissions to hospitals due to transport
#' accidents.

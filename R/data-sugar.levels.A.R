#' Simulated fasting blood sugar levels for 100 residents of a hypothetical neighborhood labeled A.
#'
#' Simulated individual fasting blood sugar levels (nmol/L) drawn from  a normal
#' distribution. Generally, normal fasting blood sugar level are between 3.0 - 5.6 nmol/L;
#' levels in the range 5.6 - 6.9 nmol/L are considered pre-diabetes. These data
#' and sugar.levels.B are used in the Unit 4 lab of Introductory Statistics for
#' the Life and Biomedical Sciences (ISLBS). See \url{https://github.com/OI-Biostat/oi_biostat_labs} for the full set of labs.

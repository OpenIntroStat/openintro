#' Social experiment
#'
#' A "social experiment" conducted by a TV program questioned what people do
#' when they see a very obviously bruised woman getting picked on by her
#' boyfriend. On two different occasions at the same restaurant, the same
#' couple was depicted. In one scenario the woman was dressed "provocatively"
#' and in the other scenario the woman was dressed "conservatively". The table
#' below shows how many restaurant diners were present under each scenario, and
#' whether or not they intervened.
